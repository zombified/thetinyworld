            The window is on the roof of this wall, it prodtrudes horizontally out of the building. You think you might be able to <span class='talk' conversationid='1'>climb up a rope</span> that's hung on the wall right below the window sill.

            There's a giant door on this wall<span class='itemdescr'>, and on the floor next to the door seems to be a small basket of sewing supplies, including a <span class='item' itemid='nd11-needle-and-thread'>needle and thread</span></span>.

                    A glider would work well here -- you could fly over to the second floor window of the tower.
