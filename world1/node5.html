            You step out of the old stony tower into fresh air (with a hint of manure on the wind). It's bright compared to the tower, so you shade your eyes until they adjust.

            Following the path between the chasm and river was long and pieceful, and you've finally arrived at the magus tower. You stand now in the yard outside the old stony tower, which is surrounded by a white picket fence.

        <p>
            Following the path between the cliff and chasm, your journey was stressful. More than once you almost fell to your death. You stand now in the yard outside the old stony tower, which is surrounded by a white picket fence.

            A grassy yard with a white picket fence at it's edge. The grass seems well tended. In the north-east corner you see a old shed with a window protruding from it's roof. Next to the shed is a <span class='talk' conversationid='2'>water pump</span><span class='itemdesc'>. with a <span class='item' itemid='nd5-bucket'>bucket</span> tipped over under it.</span>

        <p>
            The path between cliff edge and chasm makes it's way towards the large stone dias you arrived on. Inside the white picket fence you see a sheep, pig, and cow wondering around. Occasionally the sheep will bleat, but otherwise they all seem pretty docile.
