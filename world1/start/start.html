    Welcome! Here's a few things you should know:

    <ul>
        <li>If you click in the grey area at the bottom of the screen, you can start typing! This is the command area -- hitting the <em>enter</em> key will execute the command you typed in!</li>
        <li>At any point you can type in <span class='command'>?</span> (that is, just a question mark) in the entry field, then hit the enter key, to get a list of possible commands</li>
        <li>Movement is controlled by the following commands: <span class='commandinactive'>n</span>, <span class='commandinactive'>e</span>, <span class='commandinactive'>s</span>, <span class='commandinactive'>w</span> -- which represent the 4 cardinal directions</li>
        <li>The <span class='commandinactive'>a</span> command attacks whatever is in front of you</li>
        <li>The <span class='commandinactive'>i</span> command lists the contents of your inventory</li>
        <li>The <span class='commandinactive'>l</span> command describes what you see in the direction you are facing.</li>
    </ul>

    Move <span class='command'>n</span>orth to start your game, oh, and have fun!
