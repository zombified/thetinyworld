            Ascending the stairs to the second level, the smell from the kitchen diminishes somewhat. The stairs continue up. The windows in this room are small, but there seems to be a good cross-wind getting some fresh air in. There is very little in this room except for a small bed, a floor mat, presumably where you'll be sleeping, a pile of dirty cloths, an old armoir and a simple writing desk.

            There are stairs leading up, and down. The way up is blocked by a locked door, and you really don't want to go back down to the kitchen where that slop bucket is. On the wall next to the stairs stands a tall solid armoir. You idly wonder if it was built outside the tower and brough up, or if it was built in this room.

        A window sit's squarely in the middle of this wall. Directly below is a <span class='talk' conversationid='1'>mound of clothes</span>, and next to them is the chamber pot, which reeks of old piss.

            A bird sits chirping on a window sill, under which a simple writing table sits with a high-backed chair. There isn't anything of note on the table, just some old quills and blank sheets of paper.

            There is a small straw bed shoved against the wall, raised off the floor by several flat top chests. A window let's in a bright ray of sun which hit's a pillow, half falling off the bed. On the pillow is a small short haired black cat, soaking up the sun.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the foot of the bed you see a small thickly woven mat that you assume will be your bed for the foreseeable future.
