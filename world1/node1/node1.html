            The world around you slowly comes alive. First you hear some birds chirping,
            then smell an earthy dampness. Beneath your finger tips you feel grass, and on your
            face you feel the warmth of the sun. Slowly you open your eyes, and see a beautiful
            blue sky with small whispy clouds floating lazily to nowhere in particular.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are unsure of how you got here, but as you stand you hear a wheezing "Oh, hello
            there! I'm glad you're finally awake, we can proceed."
        </p>
        <p>
            You turn north to face the owner of the voice.

            A gentle looking old <span class='talk' conversationid='1'>man</span> 
            dressed in a plain brown robe stands slightly hunched
            over a plain wooden podium with a quill in one hand, while the other holds down
            a page in a fairly thick book.
