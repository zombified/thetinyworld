            The world around you slowly comes alive. First you hear some birds chirping,
            then smell an earthy dampness. Beneath your finger tips you feel grass, and on your
            face you feel the warmth of the sun. Slowly you open your eyes, and see a beautiful
            blue sky with small whispy clouds floating lazily to nowhere in particular.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are unsure of how you got here, but as you stand you hear a wheezing "Oh, hello
            there! I'm glad you're finally awake, we can proceed."
        </p>
        <p>
            You turn north to face the owner of the voice.

            A gentle looking <span class='talk' conversationid='1'>old man</span> 
            dressed in a plain brown robe stands slightly hunched
            over a plain wooden podium. In his left hand he holds a quill, and with his
            right hand he holds down a page in a very large leather bound book. <span class='itemdesc'>An extra <span class='item' itemid='nd1-ink'>bottle of ink</span> sits on the edge of the podium.</span>
        </p>
        <p class='itemdesc'>There is a <span class='item' conversationid='2' itemid='nd1-quill'>quill pen</span> on the ground, presumably the old man has dropped it.</p>
        <p class='itemdesc'>There is a <span class='item' itemid='nd1-paper'>blank piece of paper</span> sitting on a stack of books.</p>

                He readies his pen to write something, and asks "Do you identify yourself as <span class='answer' field='gender'>male</span>, <span class='answer' field='gender'>female</span>, or, perhaps, <span class='answer' field='gender'>androgynous</span>?"</p>

                    "Fantastic!" he says, "A <span replace='gender/tgenderObj/tupper' />! You should make lots of friends!" as he scribbles something unintelligble down in the book.

                    You give the old man your drawing, adjusting it in front of his face to bring it into focus, he says "Oh excellent, excellent, I think the diviner's will have lots to say! Lots!". He sets down the drawing opposite the page he's writing on, and looks back up at you.

                    "Now, what is your-" the man's eyes glaze over momentarily, interrupting whatever he was about to say. "I'm sorry, looks like I'm going to have to cut this part short -- the high magus has give instruction to see you off to the master magus you will be studying under."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The man sets down his quill, and picks up a round shiny object. "Now, <span replace='gender/tgenderChild' />, I'm sure you have a lot of questions. Usually we get to introductions after I ask your name, but there's no time for that now." You hear him mutter something under his breath, and see him wave his right hand over the object in his left hand. "I'm sorry I don't have the time to prepare you for this, but the pain should be brief."
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you are about to ask him what is going on, you feel like you're being compressed and stuffed in side a box -- you're vision becomes all stretched and skewed, and when the pain becomes unbearable, you pass out.
