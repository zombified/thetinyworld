            The world around you slowly comes alive. First you hear some birds chirping,
            then smell an earthy dampness. Beneath your finger tips you feel grass, and on your
            face you feel the warmth of the sun. Slowly you open your eyes, and see a beautiful
            blue sky with small whispy clouds floating lazily to nowhere in particular.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are unsure of how you got here, but as you stand you hear a wheezing "Oh, hello
            there! I'm glad you're finally awake, we can proceed."
        </p>
        <p>
            You turn north to face the owner of the voice.

            A gentle looking <span class='talk' conversationid='1'>old man</span> 
            dressed in a plain brown robe stands slightly hunched
            over a plain wooden podium with a quill in one hand, while the other holds down
            a page in a fairly thick book.

                    "Now, what is your-" the man's eyes glaze over momentarily, interrupting whatever he was about to say. "I'm sorry, looks like I'm going to have to cut this part short -- the high magus has give instruction to see you off to the master magus you will be studying under."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The man sets down his quill, and picks up a round shiny object. "Now, <span replace='gender/tgenderChild' />, I'm sure you have a lot of questions. Usually we get to introductions after I ask your name, but there's no time for that now." You hear him mutter something under his breath, and see him wave his right hand over the object in his left hand.
